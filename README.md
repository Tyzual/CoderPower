# CoderPower
A Xcode Plug-in imitating the activate-power-mode atom package. Shake &amp; Spark effect included.

##Install
Clone this repo and build it

##Update log
*	Add a menu item to disable the plugin
*	Adjust effect details

~~Default color is white for black editor background color. Some settings (like changing color of the effect) can be found under Xcode's Edit Menu.~~

Since get the color of the text which is just infront of the caret is a little bit tricky. The color of the effect is random;

~~Just a buggy version with simple visual effect. Hope I will update it continually..~~

~~It is buggy (and unfinished) now, and I'm finish it....~~

It works fine now, and i'm adding some 'additional' feature.(such as configurable effect color, etc...)
